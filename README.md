# The Godwin Text Editor

**Based off of vim modes and commands but made for the 21st century**

## Installation

**TODO** *(this project is no-where near done yet)*

## Basic Editing

**TODO**

## Why?

Why does the world need another text editor?

This project was made based on some grievances I had with (Neo)Vim, but with a love for their simplistic aesthetic which came with being a tui (or tui-like) application.

## Goals of this project

- [ ] Multi-cursor support out-of-the-box

- [ ] Keymap documentation to help you while writing commands

- [ ] A good starting point out of the box which can be easily expanded on

- [ ] Easy and beautiful theming for all tastes

- [ ] Easy config via a `config.toml` file

- [ ] Robust plugin support (this will be one of the later goals of this project)

- [ ] Builtin lsp support via treesitter (another later goal)
